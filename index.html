						<h2>Rose</h2>
						<p>Roses do not bloom hurriedly; for beauty, like any masterpiece, takes time to blossom.The more you love roses the more you must bear with thorns.If roses were not special weeds would not envy them.A rose in a desert can only survive on its strength, not its beauty.</p>

                    	<h2>Jasmine</h2>
                    	<p>Jasmine's meaning varies by place and culture, but it often symbolizes love, beauty or sensuality. Its pure white blossoms can also symbolize purity. Because the small, unassuming white flowers bloom at night with such a powerful scent, jasmine sometimes symbolizes the value of modesty.</p>

						<h2>Lilly</h2>
						<p>It's the most sacred and beautiful of all flowers in Egypt.Faith is like a lily, lifted high and white.The rose does best as a rose.A lily or a rose never pretends, and its beauty is that it is what it is.A lily of a day.There is a garden in her eyes, where roses and white lilies flow.</p>
